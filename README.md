# DataStructure-Trees
This repository was developed to show examples of visualization of data structures, specifically trees.

## Binary Search Tree
Basically, this tree always works with two nodes, left and right. The left node is always smaller than 
the parent node, but the right node is always bigger than the parent node.

## Red Black Tree
This is a BST that simulates a 2-3 tree, each double node is represented by two simple nodes connected 
by a red link (always leaning to the left).

## Tries
This tree is used to implement string symbol tables, each node can have n children, one for each 
possible character.
